### ðŸ“šUpdating News
#### ðŸ§€ 2024.09.27
We have reorganized the previous pipeline and opened a new python library called opensdpc. Here are some of its features:
1. Corrected the usage of some functions in the previous sdpc-for-python and sdpc-linux libraries. Now they are completely aligned with the openslide library. Specifically, the following two contents have been changed: 
  -  `slide.level_dimension` -> `slide.level_dimensions`
  -  `img = Image.fromarray(slide.read_region((cut_x, cut_y), patch_level, (tile_size, tile_size)))` -> `img = slide.read_region((x_start, y_start), args.WSI_level, (x_offset, y_offset)).convert('RGB')`
2. The previous method required changing the environment variables, now it is no longer neccessary to modify them manually
3. The previous sdpc and openslide library have been integrated, now a unified interface is used to call them. Therefore, the opensdpc supports .sdpc and all WSI formats supported by other openslide libraries.

#### ðŸ§€ 2024.09.22
1. Some users' machines are not compatible with the latest compiled packages. For this reason, you can still use old versions. See: [old version for sdpc library](https://github.com/WonderLandxD/sdpc-for-python/tree/4c03a32473eb88f24283446c0967e5053f083896).
2. Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot directly provide the software for converting sdpc to svs. I am actively communicating with the company and providing an open source interface. Please contact the slide-scanner after-sales staff to request it. See [sqray.com](https://www.sqray.com/service/scanFilm) for more details.
3. Provide an example for generating patches with multiple thread in order to provide pre-processing for huge datasets. See [this subsection](https://github.com/WonderLandxD/sdpc-for-python/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#demo-code-of-using-sdpc-and-openslide-library-to-crop-the-patches).

[Note]
 please use **version==1.5** if you want to use sdpc-linux. I may be slow to reply, thank you for the patience ðŸ˜Š.

If you don't know how to deal with the old version, here is a simple plug-and-play process:
- Step1: Click the [Tsinghua cloud link](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/d1da5598c9c849d98e3f/?dl=1) to download LINUX.zip directly;
- Step2: Replace the unzipped LINUX folder with the LINUX folder of the sdpc package in your own environment;
- Step3: Write the absolute path of the LINUX folder and the ffmpeg folder inside it into the environment variable, see the issue [#2](https://github.com/WonderLandxD/sdpc-for-python/issues/2) for more details
- Step4: Just enter `import sdpc` in python to use it. 

#### ðŸ§€ 2024.02.03
1. Updated Part "Troubleshooting"

#### ðŸ§€ 2023.12.26
1. **sdpc-linux** and **sdpc-win** are no longer be updated. The latest library **sdpc-for-python** is a new version for Sdpc Python library, which can be used in both Windows and Linux Systems.
2. The color correction has been updated. Now the color of the cropped patches are consistent with the color in the reading software.
3. Changed function name `level_downsample` to `level_downsamples`.
4. Chineses paths have been supported.
5. Added a function to view the magnification directly: `wsi.scan_magnification()`.
6. Added a function to view the sampling ratio directlyï¼š`wsi.sampling_rate()`.
7. Added a function of obtaining the thumbnail image: `wsi.get_thumbnail(thumbnail_level)`.
8. The `wsi.crop_patches()` function has been added. Now you can call the function directly in the code to separate the foreground tissue area and crop the patches (Using Pillow Library to save patches).
9. Added a option that can normalize images in `wsi.crop_patches()` function, it normalizes by H and E channels.

### ðŸ”¥ Introduction about opensdpc (extended from openslide)

**opensdpc** is a python library for processing whole slide images (WSIs) in **sdpc** format extended form [openslide](https://openslide.org/) library, therefore, opensdpc also supports other common formats such as svs, tiff, ndpi, etc. To read WSIs in **sdpc** format in Windows platform, download the [TEKSQRAY reading software](https://www.sqray.com/Download).

### ðŸŽˆInstallation
There are several versions available. For Linux users, we now **recommend** using the local installation method. This is a simple way to install the library and you can see the solutions when you encounter some problems such as `OSError: libDecodeHevc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

First, clone the repo and cd into the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/WonderLandxD/opensdpc.git
cd opensdpc
```

Then, install the openslide library:
```sh
apt install openslide-tools
pip install openslide-python
```

Finally, create a conda env and install the library in editable mode:
```sh
conda create -n piano python=3.10
conda activate piano
pip install -e .
```

For Windows users, we will provide a simple way to install the library in the future.

---------

### ðŸš€ Basic usage
There are two example WSIs in the `data` folder, which are in the **sdpc** format and **svs** format (download from [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM/blob/master/heatmaps/demo/slides/C3L-01663-21.svs)) respectively. 

<img src="cover/slide_demo.png" width="700px" align="center"/>

We will use the **sdpc** format WSI as an example to demonstrate how to use basic functions of opensdpc.

```
import opensdpc

slide = opensdpc.OpenSdpc('data/20220514_145829_0.sdpc') # load the WSI

print(f'This WSI have {slide.level_count} levels.') # the number of levels

print(f'The magnification of this WSI is {slide.scan_magnification}x.') # the magnification of the WSI

print(f'The downsampling ratio of this WSI is {slide.sampling_rate}.') # the downsampling ratio of the WSI

print(f'The downsample ratio of each level is {slide.level_downsamples}.') # the downsample ratio of each level

print(f'The dimensions of each level is {slide.level_dimensions}.') # the dimensions of each level

thumbnail = slide.get_thumbnail(3) # get the thumbnail of the WSI
print(f'The thumbnail (level 3) shape is {thumbnail.shape}.') # the shape of the thumbnail
```

you will see the result like this:
```
This WSI have 4 levels.
The magnification of this WSI is 40x.
The downsampling ratio of this WSI is 0.25.
The downsample ratio of each level is (1.0, 4.0, 16.0, 64.0).
The dimensions of each level is ((26880, 21504), (6720, 5376), (1680, 1344), (420, 336)).
The thumbnail (level 3) shape is (336, 420, 3).
```

### ðŸš‰ Generate the patches, create patch features, and so on

We provide a new easy-to-use PyTorch library with - **PIANO**: **P**athology **I**mage **AN**alysis m**O**dels to build a complete pipeline for histopathology image AI analysis, including generating patches, creating patch features with novel foundation models, and so on. Check out the [PIANO](https://github.com/WonderLandxD/PIANO) repository for more details.
